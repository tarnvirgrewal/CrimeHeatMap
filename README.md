# Crime Heatmap

This is a crime heatmap which displays the crime in the selected area. The repository contains sample data which can be used to test the project.  

## Usage

### Basic Usage

If you want to run the website, get a api code from google maps. Then open the index.html file and replace "YOURAPIKEYHERE" with your api key. 
Also note that currently the project only contains data on Victoria, Australia. Therefore to see the heatmap, type 'victoria' into the search bar. 

### Advanced Usage

If you want to display data for other locations, simply change the location path in the script.js file. Also update the center in the script.js file to the new location.
